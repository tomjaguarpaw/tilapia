# Tilapia &ndash; improving all Haskell's programmer interfaces

Tilapia is an effort to improve all the interfaces between Haskell and
the programmers who use it.  For example, it aims to improve

* the user experience that Haskell tools provide to the
  programmer (tools including GHC, Cabal, Stack, IDEs)
* the documentation of tools and libraries, by
    * providing or improving working examples
    * providing or improving tutorials
    * reporting or correcting out-of-date or misleading documentation
* the APIs of Haskell libraries so they are easier to use or to learn

Additionally, Tilapia will serve as a focal point for people not
familiar with the Haskell ecosystem so that they can raise
difficulties and ask questions about the experience they have had with
Haskell tooling and libraries.  They may not otherwise know where to
share their perspective.

Tilapia will help existing maintainers with tasks they may not have
time for, and bring to their attention helpful suggestions they may
not otherwise have considered.  One sign that Tilapia is adding value
to the community will be that existing maintainers feel that their job
becomes *easier*: our aim is that they feel pleased that their project is
being discussed or addressed by Tilapia, not threatened.

What Tilapia does not intend to do.  We are not going to add new
functionality to any tools or libraries.  Authors and maintainers already
do a great job of that.  We are not going to teach Haskell.  There are good
resources for that already.

## Examples

One good example of what Tilapia intends to do, and which in fact
partially inspired the Tilapia project, is [William Yao's experience
report of using
Reanimate](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-05-10-reanimate-an-experience-report.html).
He explained why he found the library hard to use, [wrote a
tutorial](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-05-31-reanimate-nqueens-tutorial.html)
and submitted [a documentation
PR](https://github.com/Lemmih/reanimate/pull/67), all of which
contribute to improve the experience of future users of the library.
